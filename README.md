# Animal Voice Recognition

## Overview

Welcome to the Animal Voice Recognition project! This repository contains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model designed to recognize the voices of two specific animals: cats and dogs. The primary goal of this project is to take input in the form of animal voices, remove noise, compress audio waves, and classify the input based on frequencies.

## Features

- Animal Recognition  : The SVM model has been trained to identify the distinct voice patterns of cats and dogs.
- Noise Removal       : The project incorporates techniques to eliminate background noise from the input audio data, enhancing the accuracy of animal voice recognition.
- Audio Compression   : Audio waves are compressed to streamline the data and improve processing efficiency.
- User-friendly       : This tool is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible for various applications, including use by travelers and forest officers.


## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Model

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Animal_Voice_Recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Animal_Voice_Recognition
    ```

3. Place your animal voice samples in the `input_data` directory.

4. Run the SVM model:

    ```bash
    python animal_voice_recognition.py
    ```

5. The model will process the input data, remove noise, compress audio waves, and display the predicted animal voice.

## Sample Use Case

Travelers and forest officers can utilize this tool to recognize unknown animals in the forest based on their voices. This can contribute to increased safety and awareness in natural environments.
